# GRAD COOP Template for Reforger

## Summary
GRAD COOP Template for Reforger is a mod that provides a Game Master Template for COOP missions. With the load/save feature since Arma Reforger 1.0.0 you can create your own missions with this template.

> [!WARNING]
> Use at your own risk. This mod is only for testing and still under development.

## Features
- GarbageSystem Overrride: Inventory Items like Weapons will not be deleted
- Eden Coop Template based on GM_Eden.ent (replaced default loadout manager with LoadoutManager_USxUSSR.et)
- Localisation string table to bypass error on authors in mission header
- unlocked Game Master budgets (changeable via Admin Mode for every player)
- changed supply budget costs to 0 for all items
- All loadouts for all factions available

## What the Mission Maker needs to do
- Load the mission locally (in singleplayer) build mission and save it
- start server with the template
- load mission that was build earlier
- enable the necessary factions
- place spawnpoint
(spawnpoint and faction is necessary for people to join)
